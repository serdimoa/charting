# TradingView Charting Library Overview

The Charting Library consists of a charting component that you should host on your server, and a set of APIs. Flexible design lets you quickly and easily create a charting solution with your own data - which can be in real-time or refresh-only. 

This solution is best for companies of any size that want to get top-notch HTML5 charting onto the corporate site, blog or portal as soon as possible, and for free. 

TradingView Charting Library allows you to implement your own high-end charting solution in a few steps.

* Download your [copy of Charting Library](Package-Content) and then [run it](Running-Your-Charting-Library).
* [Decide how to provide the data for charts](Choosing-Data-Transport).
* Implement your own data source solution or use an existing one. [Want samples](Datafeed-Implementation-Samples)?

After step 3 you will have a complete and working charting tool. If you want your charts to have a custom appearance, then you may go further.

* Investigate Charting Library [customization possibilities](Widget-Customization)
